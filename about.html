      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/4 I started my isolated Portfolio website on Replit, put my
        projects in it, and published it on Replit.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/6 I created MacVG (previously TonyMac129) with 286 games, lots
        of features, and more.
      </li>
      <li>⏺️ 2023/9/6 I gave my portfolio a small revamp.</li>
      <li>
        🔼 2023/9/13 I renamed TonyMac129 to MacVG and had the idea to merge all
        my websites and projects into a big personal website (what you're looking at
        right now) so it's easier to organize files and stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/9/14~16 Planned on what the website looks like; decided to put
        all my projects, webpages, websites, coding files, portfolio, and more
        in it; and changed GitHub username.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/9/17 Created MacWeb website; the basic structure of the website;
        organized MacVG, Portfolio, and all related files, folders, webpages,
        and materials into the website; created the home page; the about page;
        linked webpages to MacWeb; created the UI design; the logo; and
        published the website to GitHub.
      </li>
      <li>
        🔼 2023/9/19 Updated the broken UI and content for the "Coding" page in MacWeb Portfolio, the nav bar user effect, and fixed pages connection errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/9/22 Completed & further improved the content in the "Coding" page in MacWeb Portfolio, the nav bar revamp and UI updates on the older pages, structure reorganization, new Portfolio logo, new pages and updates projects in portfolio, and error fixes.
      </li>
