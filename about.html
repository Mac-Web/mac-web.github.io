      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/4 I started my isolated Portfolio website on Replit, put my
        projects in it, and published it on Replit.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/6 I created MacVG (previously TonyMac129) with 286 games, lots
        of features, and more.
      </li>
      <li>⏺️ 2023/9/6 I gave my portfolio a small revamp.</li>
      <li>
        🔼 2023/9/13 I renamed TonyMac129 to MacVG and had the idea to merge all
        my websites and projects into a big personal website (what you're looking at
        right now) so it's easier to organize files and stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/9/14~16 Planned on what the website looks like; decided to put
        all my projects, webpages, websites, coding files, portfolio, and more
        in it; and changed GitHub username.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⏫ 2023/9/17 Created MacWeb website; the basic structure of the website;
        organized MacVG, Portfolio, and all related files, folders, webpages,
        and materials into the website; created the home page; the about page;
        linked webpages to MacWeb; created the UI design; the logo; and
        published the website to GitHub.
      </li>
