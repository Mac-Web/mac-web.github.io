  <h1>finally finding a way to upload game files larger than 25mb to github.</h1>
  first i logged on bard and asked for help on how to use github desktop, which was my idea to use it for uplaoding things. i then watched some yt tutorials but it didnt help
  and then i successfully uploaded 10 minutes till dawn to github desktop and it worked thanks to the only useful yt tutorial
  and then i researched, changed my global identity thing, downloaded git...
  and finally went to settings from files->options and disabled SSH and it miracly worked!!!???游때游때游때游때
